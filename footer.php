					Love to play with owner's hair tie. Lick the other cats lick sellotape. Pee in the shoe. Favor packaging over toy lick yarn hanging out of own butt sniff other cat's butt and hang jaw half open thereafter. Hide head under blanket so no one can see sleep on dog bed, force dog to sleep on floor. Eat from dog's food why must they do that, shake treat bag, and unwrap toilet paper damn that dog poop in litter box, scratch the walls scratch the furniture.
